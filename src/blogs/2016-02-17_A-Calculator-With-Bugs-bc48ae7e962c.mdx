So last Thursday, we were formally introduced to Javascript in the class. The weekend challenge was to build a fully functioning calculator with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

Three days later, and I have a calculator that works, as long as you read the manual. This was definitely the most challenging assignment yet, but I worked on it all weekend to push myself, and there’s no doubt I learned a lot. By the end, I had only had to design a few functions, but the complexity in this came from the logic behind it.

Yesterday we had some straight forward “build a function that does \_\_\_\_” homework which I really enjoyed. More Javascript and I believe starting jQuery this week.

Here’s the calculator: (just don’t use it for your taxes!)
